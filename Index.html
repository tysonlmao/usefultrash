            <p>The Blue tongue Wallaby are a species of Notamacropus (Wallaby) commonly found in the lower parts of
                Australia. As well as Tasmania and including states like Victoria. And New South Wales and south
                Australia and the lower parts of western Australia some have also been seen in lower parts of Queensland
                although not verry commonly. they weigh 10kg to 20kg and have a head body length of 100cm. The Blue
                tongue Wallaby has a very similar appearance to the black-striped wallaby or the Red-necked wallaby
                lacking the stripe of the black-striped wallaby but retaining the white strip over its abdomen. But what
                most differing is its blue tongue, the first 1 to 3cm of its tongue is a strong blue colour. The wallaby
                is very shy and a nocturnal grazer and does not like to leave places it preserves as safe, like that of
                bushes. And spend most of the day at rest sleeping. It likes to hang around themselves but if there is
                an abundance of resources like Food Water as well as shelter. If they do get into groups, social
                hierarchies can from like other species of wallaby. The wallaby also reserves conflicts via a fight. The
                wallaby mostly feeds on food found in its habitat such as Roots different tree leaves Grasses and weeds.
